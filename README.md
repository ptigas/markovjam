> Why "markov jam" ?  

The system uses two models. [Hidden Markov Models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) and [Variable-Order Markov Models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-order_Markov_model).
Both models are based on [markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), developed by [Andrey Markov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov). The jam part is a bit obvious.
